Music has long been a fundamental part of cultural expression. For centuries, handwritten notation was the only way music works could be passed down. Although we are now deep into the digital age to make sure their manuscripts are both preserved and easily available is vital. Realising the potential of modern technology to solve this problem, our project will actualise an artificial intelligence solution for the digitization of handwritten music. Recent developments in Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), such as those described by Creswell et al. (2017) and Li (2022) as well as research from the author of this article, have demonstrated significant promise in the fields of image enhancement and generation. These advances in technology have led us to ask ourselves what AI, especially GANs, might contribute to eliminating the problems of identifying handwritten music superimposed with variable and intensely appealing features. This project seeks to integrate these state-of-the-art AI techniques with traditional methods for preserving music. We plan to provide an outcome that bests both the accuracy and accessibility of our musical heritage in an era which reinvents itself digitally.The challenge we are facing goes beyond merely digitizing handwritten music; it involves accurately capturing the nuances, the personal touch of the composer, and the historical context embedded within each manuscript. Traditional Optical Music Recognition (OMR) systems have struggled with the complexity and variability of handwritten notations, often losing the subtle details that make each piece unique. This issue is particularly pressing because these manuscripts represent not just musical notes, but a vital link to our cultural and historical heritage.To address this challenge, we have opted to leverage Enhanced Super-Resolution Generative Adversarial Networks (ESRGANs), a cutting-edge AI technology known for its superior performance in image generation and enhancement. This approach was chosen because of ESRGAN's proven ability to produce high-resolution images that retain intricate details, which is critical for the accurate digitization of handwritten music. Unlike traditional methods, which often falter when faced with the variability of handwriting, ESRGANs offer the potential to faithfully replicate the fine details of each manuscript, ensuring that the digital versions are as true to the originals as possible.By integrating ESRGANs into an OMR system, our approach aims to push the boundaries of what is possible in music digitization. This method not only enhances the fidelity of the digital copies but also ensures that the cultural and historical essence of the manuscripts is preserved. This project is more than a technical endeavour, it is a mission to safeguard our musical heritage by harnessing the latest advancements in AI, ensuring these.
